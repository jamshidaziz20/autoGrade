Things that need to be worked on:
	-If student java file needs to recieve data from Command line 
	-Complex method that compares the output of the txt file and Student's file
	-Extract a single method and test it against sample data
	-Compare the phrase, ignore the format of the output. (Unless specified by professor).
	-handle the case of student file compile file (infinite loop)
	
	
	-convert to a JAR 
	-return a stringfied json
		-status: 0 or 1 (compilation record of the student file)
		-result: pass or fail. (compare the student file with the expected output)
		-message: if status is 1, send error message. else "everything is good."
		-studentOutput: the output of the student
		-expectedOutput: the expected output
		-processTime: return list of start and end of compilation and start and end of testing the code.
